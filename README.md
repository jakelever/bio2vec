This is a small repo with scripts that install word2vec, convert PubMed XML files to raw text and runs word2vec. This is http://bio.nlplab.org resources for biomedical text mining

## Usage

The basic usage of this requires a downloaded copy of the Pubmed XML files (yearbly baseline available from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/baseline/). It will process these files and compile a copy of word2vec and run the tool. The single command looks like below.

``` sh
